#!/usr/bin/env bash
# elder-inject-startup.sh <N>
#
# Inject the 3-command startup sequence into elder-N's tmux REPL:
#   /clear
#   /rename "Clan World: <Name>"
#   /color <color>
#
# Usage:
#   ~/clan-world/bin/elder-inject-startup.sh 1     # inject into elder-1 only
#   ~/clan-world/bin/elder-inject-startup.sh all   # inject into all 4
#
# Pauses between commands to let the CLI process them in order. Each submit
# sends Enter, waits 250ms, then sends Enter again because Claude Code can drop
# the first Enter after tmux send-keys.
# Safe to re-run — /clear is idempotent, /rename + /color are stateless setters.
#
# Why a separate helper instead of running these inline in run.sh:
#   Slash commands like /clear, /rename, /color are processed by the Claude
#   Code CLI's input layer (typed-in commands), NOT by the model or by env
#   vars. They have to be physically typed into the REPL after it's running.
#   tmux send-keys with sleeps is the only reliable way.
